## Debian to Kali Linux Conversion Script

This script automates the process of converting a Debian-based system to Kali Linux, performing a full system upgrade, and installing resource monitoring tools (htop, bpytop, neofetch). It also sets up Node.js and npm for additional functionality.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the script:

1. Open a terminal on your Debian-based system.
2. Download the script:

   # bash
 ```
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thepwnexperts/advance-things/main/linux/vps/conversion/pure%20deb%20to%20kali/con_deb_to_kali.sh 
    chmod +x con_deb_to_kali.sh 
    sudo ./con_deb_to_kali.sh 
```

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run the script and exercise caution when executing scripts from external sources.
